# whichcraft

whichcraft is a full-stack web web application that combines front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) with back end technologies (Ruby on Rails in this case).  Our team used Materialize, Google's responseive CSS framework to help build our site.

## Our Pitch
We wanted to create a platform to bring people who make fine crafts (crafters) and people who appreciate their products (henceforth known as crafteeeeees) together.  Through whichcraft, crafters would be able to showcase their crafts via a customizable portfolio, offer their services to the community through our event management feature, as well as access payment services.  Craftees would be able to search, obtain and enjoy bespoke services from the finest of craftsmen.

This idea was inspired by the growing art industry in Singapore, and recognizing the lack of a proper online platform for creatives to expose their works.  Skilled craftsmen in Singapore currently do not really have a centralized digital platform for them to display and share their crafts and services.  Their services are usually made known through word-of-mouth (which people seem to like and trust!  More so than Google searches).  Our platform seeks to help craftsmen to promote their expertise in their craft and have opportunities for inter-disciplinary networking.  Hopefully it would also help the local community to uncover hidden gems and enjoy unique products and services.

## Development
We spent a fair bit of time coming up with our **E**ntity **R**elationship **D**iagram because we knew we would have quite a fair number of models.  After a number of iterations, our ERD is as follows:

materialize and css
stripe-connect API for multi-seller.  
extended devise to

Realized we needed to keep crafter and craftee accounts separate for better route management further into the project.
